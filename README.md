# My-Swift-Journey-

# SwiftJourney 🚀

**SwiftJourney** is a personal project that tracks my daily progress as I learn **Swift** and **SwiftUI**.  
Each “Day” in the app represents a chapter of my learning — from writing my very first lines of Swift code to creating beautiful, interactive user interfaces.

## 🧩 About the Project
This app is more than just code — it’s my documented journey of growth as a developer.  
Every day explores a new topic, concept, or small project. I’ve organized each day as a separate, navigable section within the app to make learning structured and fun.

- 📅 **Day-wise learning:** Each day focuses on one or more SwiftUI concepts.  
- 💡 **Interactive examples:** Practical demonstrations and mini projects.  
- 🧠 **Progressive growth:** Starts from Swift basics, moves toward complex UI building and logic handling.  
- 🎨 **Modern UI:** Built entirely with SwiftUI using gradients, animations, and glass effects.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Swift  
- **Framework:** SwiftUI  
- **Architecture:** MVVM (where applicable)  
- **Platform:** iOS (iPhone & iPad)

## 🌱 My Goal
To record my entire journey of becoming a better **iOS developer** — day by day, concept by concept.
